                <p>Being my first lab for this program, I was nervous, but as I learned about and practiced problem-solving methods with my group mates, I quickly grew enthusiastic about the event. A memorable moment from the day was the icebreaker where in a circle, a person says one of their interests, and someone with the same hobby joins them. I also liked analyzing how I work in a team with the KAI assessment and learning about how different profiles complement each other.</p>

                <p>This lab was larger, but it gave a greater opportunity to connect with the other participants and mentors which I enjoyed. At my table, I met an engineer who worked everywhere from Caterpillar to the national Sandia Labs. Compared to the first lab, I was able to meet engineering alumni and specifically learn about what skills are valuable for the field.</p>
