                <p>Grainger WIE Ambassador, Fall 2025 – present</p>
                <p>Since I’m able to work with women in engineering who are senior to me, I’ve observed how they focus on making strong connections with students to foster a positive environment. For example, during an Engineering Open House event, the ambassadors would have a conversation with one student at a time. Intermittently, she would make a lighthearted comment to everyone, so all the participants feel included. I saw how the students would be smiling and talking to each other after the event, not just having learned something but also feel more confident in their future. As I’ve continued being an ambassador, I strive to instill these practices by being sincerely curious about the students I’m talking to. When I was a mentor at the Women in Engineering Orientation this summer, I made sure to encourage conversation between freshman while also paying attention other freshmen who were more reserved. Being in their position only a year prior, I wanted to be a senior that made others feel like they belonged. When I was a freshman at the same orientation, I had struggled to branch out since I was in an unfamiliar place; although, when a mentor reached out to me and asked me about what I liked outside of engineering, I felt heard and safer. This feeling carried over into the school year which emboldened me to make friends in my classes and get involved on campus. </p>

                <p>This goes into what strengths I brought to the team as a woman in engineering. Since I had experience with leadership in high school where I hosted my own club as well as aided my robotics team, I had a clearer idea of what it took to be a mentor. I knew that leadership involves more listening than talking, so when volunteering at WIE events, I aim to start conversations instead of taking over with overwhelming advice. Additionally, since I’ve worked in a team before, I was able to create bonds with fellow ambassadors by listening to their ideas and contributing my own efforts. During a panel where the ambassadors were answering various student questions, I made an effort to actively listen to the others’ advice and build off it, so the conversation was more cohesive. By doing these small actions, I met a lot of good friends through the WIE program, so whenever I attend an event, the environment is already more open because my friends are there. Thinking back to when I was a freshman, having a comfortable environment where the mentors felt free to talk encouraged me to get to know my peers as well. Overall, by listening to others, my strengths illustrate a picture where ambassadors and students alike feel safe expressing themselves.</p>
