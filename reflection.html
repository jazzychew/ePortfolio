                <p>Integrity</p>
                <p>Participating in this program helps me deal with difficult situations with clear intention as well as identify when to use certain techniques. For example, in “Fostering a Culture of Feedback”, I learned that before giving feedback, I should look at what the subject of feedback knows versus what the surrounding team knows. In one case, if the subject of feedback does not know they need feedback, but the surrounding team knows that they do, the subject is in a state of ignorance and should receive feedback. By learning more about the importance of giving context when providing feedback, I’ve improved on my delivery of advice since I can be more assertive but also understanding and honest.</p>

                <p>Cultural Competency</p> 
                <p>In pursuing the leadership certificate, I’ve been able to grow my cultural competency by understanding myself more and being able to extend support to others through tough problems. An experience that significantly strengthened this was the “Creative Problem Solving” lab since I took a KAI test to learn my own problem-solving style, and during the workshop, all participants shared their own. The workshop allowed me to create connections between differing styles and acknowledge how our own experiences inform our actions. Through this workshop and others, I am better equipped to combine diverse perspectives to be able to solve a variety of issues.</p> 
                <hr>

                <p>Innovation</p>
                <p>Going through the activities for this certificate, my innovation competency has been improved because I’ve learned clear pathways of thinking when approached with conflict or challenges. For example, the “Addressing Conflict in Teams” workshop provided methods on how to resolve a conflict that benefits all parties involved. By observing the situation first in order to identify a sufficient resolution style then communicating with all parties to get on the same page, I can successfully resolve conflict in the best interest of everyone involved. Overall, as a leader, I feel more confident in guiding team members through challenges and building upon tried methods to encourage innovation.</p>

                <p>Sustainabiilty</p>
                <p>The certificate’s programs have provided tools that I can utilize to maintain long-lasting and sustainable teams. “Practicing Servant Leadership” is one example of this since in this workshop, I learned how to be a leader that can serve my team members instead of constantly expecting my team to appease my demands. I think this is crucial to what I learned in this program because in my past experiences, I’ve enjoyed teams where I feel heard, and as a result, in those teams, I was able to contribute more innovative ideas that sustain the team. As a leader, one of my core goals is to create a positive environment where everyone’s ideas are embraced because I think that collaboration is what distinguishes successful, maintainable teams from more short-lived ones.</p>

                <p>Final Reflection</p>
                <p>The certificate program was overall positive since I was able to gain new perspectives on leadership from professionals as well as peers, and what was especially valuable was that the program provided clear methods on how to apply the information. An experience where I was able to practice my verbal skills and demonstrate my skills that went well was the “Networking and Personal Brand” lab. At the same event, I faced an overarching challenge with myself when trying to effectively summarize what I was trying present. When networking, I found it challenging to condense my thoughts, but I was able to overcome it by critically planning out my main points either on paper or mentally which helped me in other workshops and leadership experiences. What surprised me from this program was how interactive it was; I didn’t expect much of the crucial learning to involve actively listening and talking with peers.</p> 
                <p>I’ve been able to grow into a more introspective and stronger leader through this program. I enjoyed how all the workshops I attended emphasize the importance of understanding our current styles first to build upon new methods; one workshop “Telling my Leadership Story” helped clarify my motivations into a memorable example I can communicate effectively. It was these sections of the program’s events that reinforced my leadership’s foundation. Additionally, actively applying my past experiences and what the program taught helped me become more vocal leader. For example, in “Fostering a Culture of Feedback”, I was able to roleplay in situations where I opened myself to feedback as well as provided other people feedback using what I learned from the workshop. </p>
                <p>Now that I’ve completed the workshop, my definition of leadership has changed slightly in regard to the role of the leader. Before, my perceived role of the leader focuses on them simply combining the members’ wishes and putting it to action. Now, I better understand that the leader should have a highly active role in encouraging member feedback as well as making sure members are well equipped to handle conflicts or struggles. Through attending workshops and labs, I was able to roleplay in numerous situations as both a leader and team member, so I directly saw the leader’s role in leading the conversation.</p>
                <p>From my life, I saw parallels between this experience and “The Yamato Brave” story from the Japanese Kojiki. Yamato originally starts as a simple, unknowing agent who follows orders without question. Due to this characteristic, Yamato willingly commits many brutish acts without thinking of the consequences. However, as the story progresses, and he connects with others, he becomes conscious of the untrustworthy leadership he was obeying and grows into an admired, honorable leader. This reminds me of my experience because while I’m not a assailant like Yamato, I did start off relatively naïve about my role in teams, but after talking with numerous people through this program, I feel like I’m a more capable leader with strong integrity.</p>
