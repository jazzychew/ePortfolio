                <p>Telling my Leadership Story, 03/06/2025</p>

                <p>Addressing Conflict in Teams, 09/18/2025</p>
                <p>I attended “Addressing Conflict in Teams” on September 18th, 2025. The workshop taught us participants about different approaches to resolving conflict between different personality types. For example, I learned I had a compromising style, and along with other styles, I learned the benefits and drawbacks of it.</p>

                <p>Fostering a Culture of Feedback, 10/16/2025</p>
                <p>I attended “Fostering a Culture of Feedback” on October 16th, 2025. The program helped educate us participants about when and how to provide feedback. For example, we learned about the Situation-Behavior-Impact model which provides objective and personal context to giving feedback.</p>

                <p>Reflection</p>
                <p>My experience at these workshops have instilled leadership techniques through effective presentations and interactive activities with peers. For example, at my first ILC workshop “Telling my Leadership Story”, we drafted our own stories to present to others. Even though it was scary to present myself, I found it valuable to have a clear outline of how to demonstrate my motivations as a leader through my story as well as practice verbal communication of it. Additionally, hearing other people’s stories and how they added emotion effectively helped me revise my story. Also knowing how to guide others and extending beyond my own self through these workshops is something I think is fundamental to being a leader. I especially enjoyed learning about servant leadership because it provided an alternative to how I typically viewed leaders. The workshop described how a commitment to listening to team members distinguishes a servant leader and when being a servant leader works best. </p>
                <p>In my current leadership roles as well as future roles I’ll have in my career, I plan to demonstrate what I learned from these workshops. From “Addressing Conflict in Teams”, I plan on building upon my compromising conflict style and deeply understanding other people’s perspectives in context of the situation’s importance. For example, if there’s a conflict that is seemingly going nowhere, I will know to practice a more assertive conflict resolution style to ensure progress. Additionally, in these situations, I can better provide feedback to improve the wider workflow of our team. Overall, as a leader, I want to integrate the values of absorbing team perspectives and consequently effectively communicating solutions as I progress in my career.</p>
